                <b>SURVIVING TEENAGERS</b>
                <br>
                <i>It might be difficult to accept, but a new approach to living happily with teenagers is for parents to look at their own behaviour.</i>
                <br>
                "The key to getting teenagers to respect you is to respect them first," says Penny Palmano, who has written a best-selling book on teenagers. "You can't continue to treat them the same way that you have been treating them for the previous 12 years they have opinions that count. <b>(1)</b>

                Palmano, who has a daughter aged 19 and a 16-year-old stepdaughter, has even allowed the children to hold several teenage parties at her home. They passed without problems. "I've found that if you have brought them up to do the right thing, and then trust them to do it, usually they'll behave well," she says. "I make them sandwiches and leave them alone. But I make it clear that <u>they have to clear up any mess.</u> <b>(2)</b> <select>

                She agrees that teenagers can be irritating: enjoying a world that is free of responsibility, yet desperate for independence. She doesn't think, however, that they are trying to annoy you. <u>Until recently, scientists assumed that the brain finished growing  at about the age of 13</u> and that teenage problems were a result of rising hormones and a desire for independence. <b>(3)</b> <select>

                The key to happiness for all, Palmano believes, is calm negotiation and compromise. If you want your teenagers to be home by 11 pm, explain why, but listen to their counter-arguments. If it's a Saturday, <u>you might consider agreeing to midnight</u> (rather than 1 am, which is what they had in mind).  <b>(5)</b> <select>
