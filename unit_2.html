                    <b>Games Developer</b>
                    <br>
                    As a child, Mike's main interests were playing video games and reading <b>(1)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value="">
                    <br>
                    His original ambition was to become a <b>(2)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> , not a games developer.
                    <br>
                    When he was at school he formed a games <b>(3)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> with other students.
                    <br>
                    He worked in his summer holidays in order to get <b>(4)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> .
                    <br>
                    One thing he enjoys is doing <b>(5)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> to find solutions for games.
                    <br>
                    He likes working with people who have both <b>(6)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> that are unlike his.
                    <br>
                    He thinks games developing is a <b>(7)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> , not something to do alone.
                    <br>
                    He has worked on many successful games and one is now a <b>(8)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> .
                    <br>
                    Large games need <b>(9)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> to develop, so he prefers working on smaller ones.
                    <br>
                    In the future, he intends to start a <b>(10)</b> <input type="text" name="input" value=""> .

                    <b>My first bike</b>
                    <br>
                    <i>Film star, Ewan McGregor, recently rode round the world on a motorbike. He talks about how he first took up riding motorbikes. </i>
                    <br>
                    My biking beginnings can be summed up in two words: teenage love. My first girlfriend was small with short, mousy blonde hair, and I was mad about her. Our romance came to an abrupt end, however, when she started going out with another guy in my hometown, Crieff. He rode a 50cc road bike first and then a 125. And whereas I had always walked my girlfriend home, suddenly she was going back with this guy. 
                    <br>
                    I was nearly sixteen by then and already heartbroken. Then one day, on the way back from a shopping trip to Perth with my mum, we passed Buchan's, the local bike shop. I urged my mother to stop the car. I got out, walked up the short hill to the shop and pressed my nose to the window. There was a light-blue 50cc bike on display right at the front of the shop. I didn't know what make it was, or if it was any good. Such trivialities were irrelevant to me. All I knew was that I could get it in three or four months' time when I was sixteen and allowed to ride it. Maybe I could even get my girlfriend back.
                    <br> 
                    I'd ridden my first bike when I was about six. My father got hold of a tiny red Honda 50 cc and we headed of to a field that belonged to a family friend. I clambered on and shot off. I went all over the field. I thought it was just the best thing. I loved the smell of it, the sound of it, the look of it, the rush of it, the high-pitched screaming of the engine. Best of all, there was a Land Rover parked next to two large piles of straw with about a metre and a half between them. I knew that from where the adults were standing it looked as if there was no distance between them. Just one large heap of straw. I thought I would have a go. I came racing towards the adults, and shot right through the gap in the straw. I was thrilled to hear the adults scream and elated that it had frightened them. It was my first time on a motorbike. It was exciting and I wanted more. 
                    <br>
                    So when I looked through Buchan's window in Perth that day, it suddenly all made sense to me. It was what had to happen. I can't remember whether it was to win back my ex-girlfriend's heart or not, but more than anything else it meant that, instead of having to walk everywhere, I could ride my motorbike to school and the games fields at the bottom of Crieff and when I went out at weekends. 
                    <br>
                    I started to fantasise about it. I spent all my waking hours thinking about getting on and starting up the bike, putting on the helmet and riding around Crieff. I couldn't sleep. Driven to desperation by my desire for a bike, I made a series of promises to my mum: I won't leave town. I'll be very safe. I won't take any risks. I won't do anything stupid. But, in fact I was making the promises up — I never thought about keeping them. 
                    <br>
                    At the time that I was begging for a bike, I'd already had an accident with a bike belonging to George Carson, the school laboratory technician. When I asked him if I could borrow it, he agreed, not knowing that I didn't have a clue how to ride it. The bike was in an alleyway up the side of the school hall. I managed to start it and zoomed down the alleyway until I crashed smack into a wall, bending the wheel and snapping the handlebars. Mr Carson came out to find me looking very red-faced. The bill for the damage came to more than £80, a fortune to a fifteen-year-old in those days and one that took me months of working as a dish washer and waiter at the Murray Park Hotel to pay back.
