                    <i>A school in California finds a new way to teach students about healthy eating.</i>
                    <br>
                    Alice Waters – chef and restaurant owner – is sitting in the kitchen gargen of the Martin Luther kIng School in Berkeley, California. The kitchen garden is called the Edible Schoolyard, and students at this public school are preparing a vegetable bed as part of a lesson. Later, they will cook what they pick as part of their school lunch. <b>(1)</b> <select>

                    </select>. Each student receives between 18 and 40 hours’ tuition a year in the Schoolyard, and as a result, what they eat at school has changed. A good part of the food grown here is used in the school’s daily meal.

And Waters hopes that they will set an example for other parts of the country as well. “We have such a huge problem of bad eating habits in the United States that teaching about food cannot be left to parents,” she says. “So many children generally are eating fast, cheap, easy food that something has to be done”

                    Typical classes in the Edible Schoolyard involve plenty of gardening activity. However, they are not a break from normal school work, as academic project are always attached. In one lesson, the students are asked to choose one part of the garden as their personal spot for the entire year. They then observe a record in a journal what happens in this spot as time progresses. They record their observations of insect life, the soil and changes to the plants. <b>(4)</b> <select>

                    Classes in the kitchen involve cooking lunch, but also link into classroom academic subject. The food cooked here includes a range of dishes from pasta to stufffed vine leaves and delicious Italia omelettes filled with herbs and vegetables. The recipe are dictated by what vegetables are available. Science is taught through nutrition and cooking techniques; geography through the effects of the seasons and eating habits around the world. <b>(5)</b> <select>

                    Today’s midday meal consists of homemade pesto and tomato sandwiches, with a big vegetable salad. Everyone is eating. Teo Hernandex, 13, says he has changed the way he eats. “I can now cook and grow things, he says. “I don’t know yet if I will continue doing so in the future, but I know I can. I have changed my attitude to food; I like some herbs and lettuce and I use less salt. It’s been fun, the teachers are nice – and there’s no hoemwork.” Teo has been in the US for only three years, but his teachers say he has learned to speak perfect English in such a short time because he is so happy at school.

Just seeing a child saying to another, “Would you like some?’ – that is the essential thing.”
