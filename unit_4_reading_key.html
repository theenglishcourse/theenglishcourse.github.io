    <ol type="A">
        <li>Judging by the happiness in <u>this garden</u> among a mixed bunch of ordinary children, <u>the answer would have to be yes</u></li>
        <li>Keeping <u>notes in this way</u> is viewed as an essential part of experimental learning.</li>
        <li><u>One lesson</u>, on European diets in the Middle Ages, ends with the children cooking roasted vegetables with herbs and garlic.</li>
        <li><u>The problem</u>, according to some critics, is that <u>these projects</u> may be just too expensive to run.</li>
        <li><u>These two projects</u> aim to provide all 10000 students in Berkeley’s public schools with good food whole also placing food at the heart of the curriculum.</li>
        <li><u>We</u> couldn’t possibly produce enough food <u>in this small space</u> to feed all 300 children.</li>
        <li><u>Lessons like this one</u> take place in the garden and kitchen and they form part of the curriculum.</li>
